            <dd>
              Curbside Thai was the first time I have ever done anything that had to do with websites, 
              and overall, it was fairly fun. It will take some time to get used to all the different things
              you can use like article, div, and the lists, but there are a lot of ways to accomplish one job
              so it shouldn't be too hard to get used to it. The hardest part for me was finding what link to
              use for the Carolina Traveler.

              Tri and Succeed Sports was also fairly fun and it was cool to see all of the different types of
              things that you can do with lists and links. I think it's nice that you can set whatever color you
              want when a user hovers over a link or has visited it previously, and custom list markers are also cool.
              The hardest part for me of this assignment was getting the quotes for the comments to work.

            <dd>
               This assignment was pretty cool to work through. With the first few assignments, I always wondered how
               the layout of websites worked but after this assignment, I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on the different
               options one has when creating a website. In particular, I liked the grids but it was a little confusing with 
               all of the nesting of elements on the info page but giving the elements IDs and having a layout already planned
               made it a lot easier.

            <dd>
               DLR was fairly simple to work through, and it was interesting to see a new way of doing things.
               Coming off of the last learning activity and try it out activity, I saw the layout of the page 
               that the activity was supposed to look like, and the first thing that came to my mind was doing
               a grid system, but the table element worked out pretty nice.

            <dd>
               The Komatsu Family assignment was also fairly simple to work through, and I liked the effect that
               the shadows had on the images. I was a little skeptical when it came around to rotating, especially
               when rotating around Z, but once you added the perspective, it turned out pretty good. I also didn't
               really think the whole map thing we did would work since we hard coded the rectangles for the links
               using pixels so if the image was a different size because of the window, it wouldn't work, but it did,
               and that was interesting to me.

            <dd>
               The Red Ball Pizza assignment was interesting to work through. I remember in the first challenge when we
               were making the assignments page, I looked at the code for the assignments page on canvas to see if I could
               do something similar and I saw these button elements but I didn't know what they did, so I just stopped there,
               so it's interesting to now see how they work. I also thought it was interesting to see all of the different types
               of labels and what they looked like.

          <dt></dt>  
            <dd>
               The Tulsa's New Year's Bash assignment was pretty easy to work through. So far, I think JavaScript is pretty interesting
               and it looks like it might be a little easier than some of the other languages I have done like Java or C++. It was
               also interesting to see how we did the continuously updating time for the countdown since I had originally thought
               of doing an infinite loop to accomplish it but it was convenient that JavaScript already has a function to pretty
               much do just what I was thinking.

          <dt></dt>  
            <dd>
               This assignment went pretty smoothly. Coming from currently working on C++, JavaScript doesn't seem all that bad
               and I like being able to just use functions and not having to basically implement already implemented data types.
               I especially like how each part of a date has a function that you can use to get the part of a date, like
               getMonth or getHours. I also like that JavaScript and C++ seem to have very similar for and if statements so I 
               don't have to learn a whole lot of new stuff yet.

            <dd>
               This assignment was fairly easy overall. The only part that gave me a little bit of trouble was in the last video
               with trying to make the part where it checks whether or not the user has the solution, because there was a lot of 
               closing and opening brackets and it was hard to tell where my problem was. As it turned out, at the start, I started
               the event handler in the for loop prior, not outside like in the video, so I just had to move a couple brackets and
               all was well.

          <dt></dt>  
            <dd>
               This assignment was also pretty easy. I like how there seems to be something new every activity that makes what we're
               doing a lot easier which I appreciate. I also like how we have a wide array of functions to use to accomplish what we
               need to so we don't have to code too much of our own functions. I will also back up what I said a couple assignments ago
               in that I like being able to just use functions and not really needing to know them well enough to re-implement them if 
               I ever needed to.

               This assignment was not too bad. I was wondering earlier today how javascript would work with forms, but more so how you
               would add a form through javascript. I would think it would be just like a table so you would make a form element, then a 
               label element and append it to the form element, etc. I think it's nice that you can not only select elements from forms
               just by doing like elements.element, but it's also nice that you can have multiple forms that you can select just as easily.
